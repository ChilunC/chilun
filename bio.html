      I am a graduate electrical engineer and Automation Engineer. I am a United States citizen. I worked my way through my undergraduate with an internship at a construction services company and earned a regular position at that plant.

      I work hard at everything I do. I traveled around Asia with my parents and settled back in Houston so I am used to traveling quite a bit. Above all, I am honest. I try to not misrepresent my abilities or lie to people. I can learn almost anything that I put time into learning. I never worked on cars, but I got a job at a dealership due to my work ethic.
    </p>

      I decided to go back to school for engineering, but I needed a job that would provide me the time and would pay. I got a low level job at a fabrication company and have slowly worked my way up from sorting random documents to supply chain management to an engineering technician.

      I became a Robotic Engineering Technician at this plant. I participated in modernizing their welding program by integrating robots into the manufacture of their products. I helped develop the new process and successfully handed the production to the welders and leads.

      I am currently an Automation Engineer at Schlumberger. I maintain current systems, fix PLC bugs, and develop new behaviors for our systems. I am also developing a new system with HMI, PLC coordination, Fanuc robot path planning, and python parameter optomization. In programming, I use FSM, machine learning, and SQL queries. I developed methods of making industrial systems communicate with AI libraries.
