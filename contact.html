      If you have ever studied geometry, you remember that by a course of reasoning, Euclid proves that all the angles in a triangle are equal to two right angles. Euclid has shown you how to work it out. Now, if you undertake to disprove that proposition, and to show that it is erroneous, would you prove it to be false by calling Euclid a liar?

      Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not trace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it simply be asked: Where is the security for property, for reputation, for life, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths which are the instruments of investigation in courts of justice ? And let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.

      "NOW as Christian reflected on this disturbing encounter, he noticed two men come tumbling over the Wall on the left-hand side of the narrow way; and they hurried along to catch up with him. The name of one was Formalist, and the name of the other Hypocrisy. So, as I mentioned, they drew near and Christian commenced a conversation with them.
      ….
      CHRISTIAN: Then why did you not enter at the Wicket-gate which is located at the beginning of this way? Don’t you know that it has been written, “He who does not enter in by the door, but climbs up some other way, that same person is a thief and a robber?”148

      FORMALIST AND HYPOCRISY: That may be so; however our countrymen have all agreed that this entrance or Wicketgate you mention is too far away. Rather they prefer to take a short cut and climb over the Wall at this point, just as we have done.

      CHRISTIAN: But will not your custom be regarded as a trespass against the Lord of the Celestial City to which we are headed, and thus a violation of his revealed will?

      FORMALIST AND HYPOCRISY: Well, don’t you trouble yourself about that. The reason is that their manner of entry has become a long established custom; in fact many witnesses would testify that it has been accepted as an established route for over a thousand years.149
      …
      Our tradition has been accepted for so long, that is for well over a thousand years, that it would doubtless be admitted as a legal ordinance by any impartial judge. However, practically speaking, we are now in the way; so what does it matter how we got in? If we are in, then we are in. As we understand it, you are in the way having entered through the Wicket-gate; and we also are in the way by means of tumbling over the Wall. So how is your present condition any different from ours?

      CHRISTIAN: I walk by the rule of my Master. You walk according to the uninformed working of your imagination.  You are already considered to be thieves by the Lord of the way. Therefore, I have little doubt that you will be found to be illegitimate pilgrims at the end of the way. You entered in by your own devising without his direction; and so you will leave by yourselves without his mercy.
      …
      However, the two intruders did have this to say. As to laws and ordinances, doubtless they were as conscientious in obeying them as he.

      CHRISTIAN: By obedience to laws and ordinances you will not be saved since you did not enter in at the Wicket-gate.15"

      "And now Caesar, upon hearing the death of Festus, sent Albinus into Judea, as procurator. But the king deprived Joseph of the high priesthood, and bestowed the succession to that dignity on the son of Ananus, who was also himself called Ananus. Now the report goes that this eldest Ananus proved a most fortunate man; for he had five sons who had all performed the office of a high priest to God, and who had himself enjoyed that dignity a long time formerly, which had never happened to any other of our high priests. But this younger Ananus, who, as we have told you already, took the high priesthood, was a bold man in his temper, and very insolent; he was also of the sect of the Sadducees, who are very rigid in judging offenders, above all the rest of the Jews, as we have already observed; when, therefore, Ananus was of this disposition, he thought he had now a proper opportunity. Festus was now dead, and Albinus was but upon the road; so he assembled the sanhedrin of judges, and brought before them the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James, and some others; and when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law, he delivered them to be stoned: but as for those who seemed the most equitable of the citizens, and such as were the most uneasy at the breach of the laws, they disliked what was done; they also sent to the king, desiring him to send to Ananus that he should act so no more, for that what he had already done was not to be justified; nay, some of them went also to meet Albinus, as he was upon his journey from Alexandria, and informed him that it was not lawful for Ananus to assemble a sanhedrin without his consent. Whereupon Albinus complied with what they said, and wrote in anger to Ananus, and threatened that he would bring him to punishment for what he had done; on which king Agrippa took the high priesthood from him, when he had ruled but three months, and made Jesus, the son of Damneus, high priest."

      "Hate to break it to you, but when you break anything down to its roots, you inevitably reach a point of simple faith. Everything begins and ends with faith. At some infinitesimal point in the logical break down, you have to say that it just is."

      "It confounds my ideological beliefs, stubbornly refuses to fit my world view, and has embarrassed my growing belief that there is no God.
      Now a confirmed atheist, I’ve become convinced of the enormous contribution that Christian evangelism makes in Africa: sharply distinct from the work of secular NGOs, government projects and international aid efforts. These alone will not do. Education and training alone will not do. In Africa Christianity changes people’s hearts. It brings a spiritual transformation. The rebirth is real. The change is good.
      I used to avoid this truth by applauding – as you can – the practical work of mission churches in Africa. It’s a pity, I would say, that salvation is part of the package, but Christians black and white, working in Africa, do heal the sick, do teach people to read and write; and only the severest kind of secularist could see a mission hospital or school and say the world would be better without it. I would allow that if faith was needed to motivate missionaries to help, then, fine: but what counted was the help, not the faith.
      But this doesn’t fit the facts. Faith does more than support the missionary; it is also transferred to his flock. This is the effect that matters so immensely, and which I cannot help observing."

      "1 This is a true saying, if a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.
      2 A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;
      3 Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;
      4 One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;
      5 (For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)
      6 Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.
      7 Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
      8 Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;
      9 Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
      10 And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless.
      11 Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things."

      "A private faith that does not act in the face of oppression is no faith at all." -- William Wilberforce

      "Some might say that one’s faith is a private matter and should not be spoken of so publicly. They might assert this in public, but what do they really think in their hearts?
